## Hi there 👋

<!--
**Rleathers1218/rleathers1218** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on customizing my LoupeDeck which landed me looking through GitHub for solutions. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of GitHub. I learned how to create this readme file through the introductory course. 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything I can't mess up because I have no idea what I'm doing yet but I'm very excited to learn!
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with the basics as I start my journey learning to customize my loupedeck and learn more about home assistant. 
- 💬 Ask me about anything but I'd only consider myself a SME in Naval Aviation
- 📫 How to reach me: I'm not sure if I should put an email or a messaging app here. I'll browse others and see what's most popular. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once took First Place at the IBJJF Pan-American Jiu Jitsu Championship.
